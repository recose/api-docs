# Reco APIs

Hello and welcome to Reco APIs page!

Here you will find all the information you need to implement, integrate, test or do other fun stuff with our APIs.

1. **Sandbox API Key**  
   Begin by contacting Reco's customer service ([kundtjanst@reco.se](mailto:kundtjanst@reco.se)) and ask for a sandbox api key.

2. **Sandbox API**  
   Continue to [sandbox API docs](sandbox-api.md). There you will find all necessary info to get you started.

   The sandbox API is the same as our [production API](reco-api-v3.md), but will not change any actual data or send emails/text messages.

3. **Production**  
   When you are done, contact Reco's customer service and tell them that you are ready to go live. Customer service will provide you with a production API key.

Happy Coding!
